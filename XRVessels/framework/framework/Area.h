// ==============================================================
// XR Vessel Framework
//
// Area.h
// Abstract base class defining an updatable or interactive area on
// a 2D or 3D panel. Typically, an Area will be created by a Component
// object, but this is not a requirement.  Areas always deal with
// absolute panel coordinates, whereas a Component will construct Area
// objects relative to the Component's top-left corner coordinates.
